                <p>
                    Hello! Iâ€™m Hibba Gulzar, a passionate fashion design student with a love for creativity and
                    craftsmanship.
                    My journey in the world of fashion began at a young age, inspired by the rich cultural textiles of
                    my
                    homeland and the timeless elegance of haute couture. Through my designs, I aim to blend tradition
                    with
                    modernity, creating pieces that tell stories and evoke emotions.

                <h2>My Inspirations</h2>
                <p>
                    I draw inspiration from a variety of sources, including the natural world, art movements, and the
                    people
                    I meet. Below are some key elements that influence my designs:

                    <h3>Nature</h3>
                    <p>
                        The delicate patterns of leaves, the fluid movement of water, and the vibrant hues of sunsets
                        all
                        influence the color palettes and textures of my work.

                <div class="inspiration-section">
                    <h3>Art Movements</h3>
                    <p>
                        I am captivated by the bold colors of Fauvism, the geometric elegance of Art Deco, and the
                        abstract
                        forms of Cubism. These art movements inform the shapes and patterns in my designs.

                    <h3>People and Culture</h3>
                    <p>
                        Fashion is a reflection of society, and I find inspiration in the diverse cultures, traditions,
                        and
                        personal stories of people around the world. Their stories shape the fabrics and silhouettes I
                        use.

                <h2>My Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    My fashion journey started with sketching dresses in the margins of my school notebooks. Over the
                    years,
                    I honed my skills by studying design techniques, working with textiles, and experimenting with
                    silhouettes.
                    Today, my portfolio includes a mix of elegant evening gowns, modern streetwear, and intricate bridal
                    wear.
                    Through each piece, I aim to push boundaries while staying true to my artistic vision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe that fashion is not just about aesthetics but also about sustainability, inclusivity, and
                    storytelling. My goal is to design pieces that make people feel confident, empowered, and uniquely
                    themselves.
